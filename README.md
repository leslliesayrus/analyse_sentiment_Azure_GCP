# analyse_sentiment_Azure_GCP
Analyze Sentiment of new trailer of The Mandatorian from YouTube

In this project I extracted the comments from Youtube through the Google Cloud API and used the Cognitive Service from Azure to make analyze the sentiments of all comments, then I create a DataFrame with all comments and analyzes sentiments and save this DataFrame in some storage. 

That's a simple way to implement a Machine Learning model without the need to build a model from scratch, In some cases, this services like the Cognitive Services from Azure can be a good option to apply Machine learning without many costs.
